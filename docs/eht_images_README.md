# Reproducing Figure 6b From Our Paper

You can recreate the image seen in Figure 6b of our paper. It is a grid of output images from the EHT pipelines in our Docker containers. 

[Insert Image here]


### Package Requirements
You do not need to be in a Docker container to run this script, however you do need to run the following commands to install the appropriate Python packages:
```
pip install Pillow==8.4.0
pip install pdf2image==1.16.0
pip install matplotlib
pip install os
pip install pandas
pip install numpy

```


### Instructions to Reproduce Figure 6b
* To reproduce the image grid in our paper, go into the `eht_images` directory and open `reproduce_fig6b_paper.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook. Run all cells. 
* If you want to use your own generated images from your runs of the Docker containers (DIFMAP, EHT-Imaging, and SMILI), simply do the following:
   1. Upload your final output images that are generated by our Docker containers into their corresponding folders in the `eht_images` directory of this repo. 
   2. From the `eht_images` directory, open `reproduce_fig6b_paper.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook. Run all cells.
   * If errors occur in the notebook, you may need to either delete the files in the `difmap_images`, `eht-imaging_images`, `smili_images` folders in `eht_images` directory or move the files in those named folders to somewhere else.
