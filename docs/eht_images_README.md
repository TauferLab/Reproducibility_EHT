# Reproducing Figure 6b From Our Paper

You can recreate the image seen in Figure 6b of our paper. It is a grid of output images from the EHT pipelines in our Docker containers. Copies of our outputs are included in `eht_images/` in the corresponding directories for convenience.

### Package Requirements
You do not need to be in a Docker container to run this script, however you do need to make sure you have Python version 3.7 or above. Run the following commands to install the appropriate Python packages:
```
pip install Pillow==8.4.0
pip install pdf2image==1.16.0
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install notebook

```


### Instructions to Reproduce Figure 6b
1. Navigate into the `eht_images/` directory and run `jupyter notebook`.
   * Jupyter Notebook should have been installed if the Python packages were installed from the above section.
2. Open `reproduce_fig6b_paper.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells. 
* If you want to use your own generated images from your runs of the Docker containers (DIFMAP, EHT-Imaging, and SMILI), simply do the following:
   1. Upload your final output images (in the form of `.pdfs`) that are generated by our Docker containers into their corresponding folders in the `eht_images/` directory of this repo. 
      * Ex. DIFMAP output images go into `difmap_images/`
   2. From the `eht_images/` directory, open `reproduce_fig6b_paper.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook. Run all cells.
   * If errors occur in the notebook, you may need to either delete the files in the `difmap_images/`, `eht-imaging_images/`, `smili_images/` folders in `eht_images/` directory or move the files in those named folders to somewhere else.
